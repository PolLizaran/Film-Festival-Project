# Film-Festival-Project

The goal of this project was to plan a schedule for a Film Festival that minimized its duration. We were given some input cases containing an amount of films, a set of available cinema rooms amb some restrictions among films. Once one film was projected in a room, no other films could be projected in the same room during that day. Moreover, as some films were highly expected by the audience, thay couldn't be projected during the same day. 

In order to handle this problem, three different methodologies were followed, going from an Exhaustive Search implementation, a Greedy one and by last following a Metaheuristic.
